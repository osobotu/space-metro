Recently, I completed the [McKinsey Forward Program](https://www.mckinsey.com/forward/overview) and during the one of the Problem Solving Workshops, we played a game to learn the concept of Agile. Summarily, you fail fast and win quickly. The idea is to get feedback quickly and improve your solution based on the feedback.

I decided to make an implementation of this game using Flutter. Here is a screenshot of my version:

## How To Play

The goal of the game is simple. Get across the board from left to right, one square at a time, within a fixed boundary, without stepping on any mines. Good luck!
