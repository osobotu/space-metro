# Space Metro

Recently, I completed the [McKinsey Forward Program](https://www.mckinsey.com/forward/overview) and during the one of the Problem Solving Workshops, we played a game to learn the concept of Agile. Summarily, you fail fast and win quickly. The idea is to get feedback quickly and improve your solution based on the feedback.

I decided to make an implementation of this game using Flutter. Here is a screenshot of my version:

## How To Play

The goal of the game is simple. Get across the board from left to right, one square at a time, within a fixed boundary, without stepping on any mines. Good luck!

## Installation

You can play the game [here](https://space-metro-by-obotu.web.app/)

OR

If you have a Flutter development environment set up, then you can

1. Clone the repo
2. Run on any Flutter supported platforms.

Go [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) for instructions on how to set up a Flutter development environment

## Future plans
